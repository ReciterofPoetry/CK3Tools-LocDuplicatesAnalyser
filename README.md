If you place this app inside a folder, it will parse all the yml folders in that folder and subfolders for multiple occurrences of a loc for any object. It will then deposit the output file with results on your desktop. If you want to parse a particular mod's locs then you should place it inside the `localisation/[language]` folder. If you want to parse several mods, then you should create a parent folder and dump in all the loc files and folders you want to compare.

This app will ignore all files that are found inside a `replace` folder unless it is placed directly inside that folder.
